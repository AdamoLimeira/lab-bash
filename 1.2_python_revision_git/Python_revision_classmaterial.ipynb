    "## What you will learn in this course\n",
    "\n",
    "During this first course of our long journey in Data Analytics, we will review the fundamentals of Python and especially the concept of loops and conditions. The goal is to give you a solid foundation to move forward more quickly in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is what we will cover:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*   What is an IDE\n",
    "*   What is a console and its main controls?\n",
    "*   Making conditions\n",
    "*   Make a FOR loop\n",
    "*   Make a WHILE loop\n",
    "\n",
    "## Developer's Toolkit\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strolling through your folders with the terminal\n",
    "\n",
    "Very often you will have to tell your console where to find the folders and files you are going to run. That's why you will need to know the main commands that allow you to perform these tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "WARNING: The commands are sometimes not the same between MAC and PC. You will have to pay attention to this depending on the machine you are going to work on. We are using Mac for writing this course but we will also put the commands for PC.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### `ls` (or `dir` on Windows)\n",
    "\n",
    "This command is used to list everything in the folder you are in. \n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "MacBook-Air-de-Antoine-2: ONE_FOLDER antoinekrajnc$ ls\n",
    ">>>> files_1.py files_2.py files_3.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "NB : For Windows, this command is not called `ls` but `dir`\n",
    "\n",
    "That's it, this covers the two main commands you need to know in your console. Now let's look at how we can execute code in our console.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### `cd`\n",
    "\n",
    "This command is to change the folder you are in. \n",
    "Here is an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "$ cd Desktop\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we go directly to the _Desktop_ folder on our computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "With `cd` and `ls`, you can walk through all your filesystem in the terminal. We will teach you more terminal commands later.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The REPL\n",
    "\n",
    "We can execute code on our console via our REPL (Read Evaluate Print Loop). To access it, just write the `python` command on your console:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "$ python\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You will enter in the REPL. This tool is very handy for testing raw code and for doing quick tests. Let's write a simple program:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "Print(\"Hello World !\")\n",
    ">>> Hello World !\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a simple program in our REPL that allows us to write _Hello World_ in our console.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the REPL has one drawback, it's that you can't change the code easily, which is not convenient because the slightest mistake will require you to rewrite all the code from scratch, which is very frustrating when you've already written 9-10 lines of code. That's why we use what we call a code editor.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### A code editor\n",
    "\n",
    "A text editor is where you'll put all your script. You have different types of text editors like Sublime, Pycharm or Notepad++. If you already have a favorite editor, use the one you like. Otherwise, we advise you Atom or Sublime which are generalist and good or Pycharm which is specialized for Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is an IDE ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Very often, instead of using the console and the text editor separately, developers prefer to use what is called an IDE or Integrated Development Environment. They allow you to bring your console and text editor (and sometimes more features) together in a graphical user interface that will help you code more easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Data Science, the most commonly used IDEs are Spyder and Jupyter. There is an equivalent of Jupyter installed in a Cloud: [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb#recent=true).\n",
    "Google Colaboratory has all the advantages of a Jupyter Notebook without you having to install anything locally on your machine !\n",

    "### The OOP structure\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by talking about the structure and vocabulary related to OOP, as this will make it easier for you to understand why we do it and the fundamental principles on which OOP is based. Here's the general structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **An object**: Anything can designate an object: a class is an object, a function is an object etc. When we don't know the type of data we are dealing with, we will talk about an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **A class**: A class is a collection of methods, variables... that will allow to execute a certain number of actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **An attribute**: These are the variables contained in a class. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **A method** : When we build functions, in a class, we are actually talking about methods. These functions have been used before, and are those that start with a dot (ex: _.pop()_)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **An instance**: An instance is an example of a class, that is, each time you are going to use a class, you are going to create an instance of that class.\n",
    "\n",
    "These five vocabulary words are the ones you need to keep in mind. You're not going to understand them all right away, that's perfectly normal. We'll build classes and it'll all come together quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why do OOP?\n",
    "\n",
    "The whole purpose of OOP is to create code that is more robust, flexible and more easily reusable. It is based on 4 principles:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Encapsulation\n",
    "2. Abstract\n",
    "3. Heritage\n",
    "4. Polymorphism\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's quickly explain each of these principles:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Encapsulation**: In OOP, we have attributes nested in classes. This allows us to \"arrange\" the variables relative to the same object (for example, we will arrange in the same object the real and imaginary parts of a complex number). It is also very useful for hiding from the user variables that are useful for the operation of the code but whose values the user does not necessarily need to know or manipulate directly. This principle of having attributes nested in classes respects what is called encapsulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Abstraction** : Abstraction tells us that: \"If there is complex code that the user doesn't need, we might as well hide it\". The idea behind this is to prevent the user from bringing bugs into the programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Heritage**: There can be a hierarchy in classes and methods. You can have parent classes and child classes that inherit the attributes of the parent class. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Polymorphism** : Polymorphism is very much related to inheritance. It means that in addition to inheriting the attributes of the parent classes, each of the methods of the parent class can adapt to different possible situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will help you understand how classes are built, but you don't have to rack your brains about it right now. You'll understand as we create classes."
